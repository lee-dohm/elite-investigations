## Common Tasks

This project follows the [GitHub "scripts to rule them all" pattern](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/). The contents of the `scripts` directory are scripts that cover all common tasks:

* `script/test` &mdash; Runs automated tests, format and linter checks
* `script/server` &mdash; Launches the local development web server
* `script/console` &mdash; Opens the development console
* `script/db-console` &mdash; Opens the database console for the development database
* `script/docs` &mdash; Generates developer documentation
* `script/translate` &mdash; Extract and merge new message strings in `priv/gettext`

See the documentation at the top of each script for more information about what each one does and is capable of.

Other scripts that are available but not intended to be used directly by developers:

* `script/bootstrap` &mdash; Used to do a one-time install of all prerequisites for a development machine
* `script/cibuild` &mdash; Used to run automated tests in the CI environment
